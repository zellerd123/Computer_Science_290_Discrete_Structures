** Computer Science 290: Discrete Structures**
Welcome to my repository for Computer Science 290, focusing on Discrete Structures. This course is a cornerstone of computer science, delving into the essential mathematical theories and principles that underpin computer algorithms and systems.

#
**Course Overview**


Discrete Structures encompasses a variety of topics that are fundamental to computer science. This course covers:

Logic and Proof: Introduction to formal logic, methods of proof, and logical reasoning.
Sets, Functions, and Relations: Basic properties and operations of sets, functions, and relations, and their applications in computer science.
Combinatorics and Discrete Probability: Principles of counting, permutations, combinations, and basic discrete probability.
Graph Theory: Graphs, trees, and other discrete structures, along with their properties and applications in algorithms and networking.
Algorithms and Complexity: Basic concepts of algorithms, their design, analysis, and complexity considerations.
#
**Projects and Assignments**
This repository contains a selection of projects and assignments that I have completed as part of this course, demonstrating my understanding and application of discrete structures in solving computational problems.
#
**Project 1:** Array backed set: 
Description: Implement five functions, then Powerset Generation and Analysis
#
**Project 2:**  Satisfiability Solver: 
Description: implement an algorithm which accepts a proposition written in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and returns true if there exists a satisfying assignment for the proposition or false if the proposition is unsatisfiable
#
**Project 3:** Logical Normal Forms
Description: write an algorithm that converts any proposition to conjunctive normal form (CNF)
#
**Project 4:** Bloom Filters
Description: Create a functional bloom filter
#
**Project 5:** Transitive closures: 
Description:  write two variations of a function which generates the transitive closure of a given relation. Relations will be represented with a two dimensional boolean array
#
**Technologies Used**
**Programming Languages:** Java
**Tools and IDEs:** Visual Studio Code
